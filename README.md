## How to contribute _outline_
1. Fork the repo or git pull main branch
2. npm init in the terminal
3. create a .env file in the server folder (dm #project channel on discord and i'll send you api keys)
4. run the backend by going into the server folder and doing npm run dev in the terminal
5. run the front end by going into the src folder and doing run npm start

# Step by Step after you fork the repo
1. Get into the UMNBC_Website_Fork directory
2. Then run the back-end and front-end
3. server runs the back-end, src runs the front-end
## -> server folder
    - check by doing pwd in terminal
    - cd .. (this moves you a folder back/out)
    - cd [[folder-name]] (this moves you into the folder)
    - npm run dev (once you are in the server folder. So ex in terminal: cd server)
## -> src folder
    - same process as above to get to the server folder
    - npm start

## If you need help with cd and terminal
