<h1> Task: </h1>
    <ul>
    <li>Create a navbar (a navbar could/should include)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>UMNBC, About Us, Resources, Events</li>
        <li>Colors are red and white but you're welcome to change it</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Check out andysnavbar in github if you want to see an example</li>
</ul>

<h1> Setup </h1>
<br><em>Purpose: To teach you how to clone a github repository onto your computer and tools needed for all future projects</em><br>
<h3>Intall the npm packages we have on this repository/project</h3>
<p><strong>Skip if you know how to use node,npm, and git, else continue following the steps</strong></p>
<p>1. Check if you have npm&node on your computer by running npm -v and also node -v <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js">Guide to installation</a></p>
<p>2. Make sure you have git installed <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git">Follow this tutorial if you don't it installed</a></p>
<p>3. Clone this project <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics">How to clone a github repo (intro to git)</a><p>
<p>4. Install all the modules by doing npm i in your terminal<p>
<h3>Create your own branch</h3>
<p><strong>If you know about git branches, you can skip this part and just get started on the navbar</strong></p>
<p>5. Go to the correct directory, once you're there you can make your own branch (scroll below if you need help moving directories)</p>
<p>6. Create your own branch by doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>git branch yourname_navbar</li>
<li>git checkout yourname_navbar</li>
<li>Note: yourname_navbar can be anything, it's just to make things simpler if we name it your name + navbar for aesthetic purposes <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors">Learn more</a></li>
<li>Once you're done with your navbar, push the code to the github. If you're unsure how to, read below</li>
</ul>


<h1>Commands to keep in mind (5 Minute CrashCourse on using the terminal (important)): </h1>
<ul>
<li><h3>Terminal:</h3></li>
    <ul><li>pwd (check where you're at / the position you're at in the directory. So if you want to cd to places make sure you're in the correct directory to do so)</li><li>ls (check what files and folders are in your current directory that you're in. Example type ls in your terminal)</li><li>cd (move directories. Example: cd Desktop [enter, then I would do] cd csci1133/ [enter, because I have a csci1133 folder on my Desktop])</li>
    </ul>
<li><h3>git (also the terminal)</h3></li>
<ul><li>git status (checks the stage that you're on and see what needs to be commited or if you've made any changes)</li><li>git add App.js (this would add App.js to the next stage of ready to be commit along with a message of what you've done. I can only do git add App.js if I've changed something inside App.js (also make sure if you're in the same folder, else type in whatever the terminal tells you when you do git status and want to add App.js). Example it might say commited changes: src/App.js, then you would do git add src/App.js)</li><li>git commit (this would bring you do a file where you would put whatever you did for this commit / the reason for it. So if I finished the navbar, I would say finish navbar for the homepage. (i've learned to phrase my git commits as orders / tasks for aesthetic purposes as well as readability). Example: Clean your room with a broomstick. Then close out the file once you're ready with the statement)</li><li>git push (this would push whatever you did git add for. If you finished a bunch of files and don't want to do git add (each file name) then just do git add . [and this would add all files that had been changed from the previous commit])</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

(capitalization matters so make sure you're typing in things correctly. You can always tab before you finish a word. Example: cd csci11[tab] and "33" would automatically be filled in)
