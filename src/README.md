<h1> Task: </h1>
    - Create a navbar (a navbar could/should include)
        - UMNBC, About Us, Resources, Events
    - Welcome to check out andysnavbar in github if you want to see an example

<h1>Commands to keep in mind (5 Minute CrashCourse on using the terminal (important)): </h1>
    - Terminal:
        - pwd (check where you're at / the position you're at in the directory. So if you want to cd to places make sure you're in the correct directory to do so)
        - ls (check what files and folders are in your current directory that you're in. Example type ls in your terminal)
        - cd (move directories. Example: cd Desktop [enter, then I would do] cd csci1133/ [enter, because I have a csci1133 folder on my Desktop])
    - git (also the terminal)
        - git status (checks the stage that you're on and see what needs to be commited or if you've made any changes)
        - git add App.js (this would add App.js to the next stage of ready to be commit along with a message of what you've done. I can only do git add App.js if I've changed something inside App.js (also make sure if you're in the same folder, else type in whatever the terminal tells you when you do git status and want to add App.js). Example it might say commited changes: src/App.js, then you would do git add src/App.js)
        - git commit (this would bring you do a file where you would put whatever you did for this commit / the reason for it. So if I finished the navbar, I would say finish navbar for the homepage. (i've learned to phrase my git commits as orders / tasks for aesthetic purposes as well as readability). Example: Clean your room with a broomstick. Then close out the file once you're ready with the statement)
        - git push (this would push whatever you did git add for. If you finished a bunch of files and don't want to do git add (each file name) then just do git add . [and this would add all files that had been changed from the previous commit])

(capitalization matters so make sure you're typing in things correctly. You can always tab before you finish a word. Example: cd csci11[tab] and "33" would automatically be filled in)
